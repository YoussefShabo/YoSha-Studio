background grey color: #486284
golden color: #ffce39

- Logo designed on Canva.com
- map was embedded from google maps
- Boostrap was used for the main container to give margins
- Skeleton was used to style text

Basic app structure is based on the CRUD app examples from previous lectures and labs.
used Snazzymaps.com to embed a stylized map on the website with linked pop-ups to the loaction and the project. code to the map is: 
<iframe src="https://snazzymaps.com/embed/473271" width="75%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

I used a modal system to switch between the map view of the projects and the grid view!







// Issues I faced:

- formatting the text from the database to display as separate paragraphs instead of one big block of text
- linking an HTML ti the app was a little tricky and and then trying to use the include tags to include the head and the header hasn't been resolved yet!
