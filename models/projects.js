    typology: 'Infrastructure',
    description: `Connecting, therefore is a keyword, is a fundamental action to ensure the well-functioning of the city.

    This sequence of bridges will do more than just connect vital functions; they will be platforms to support the liveliness of the city by bringing the citizens together by the waterfront.
    
    This will have to be done bearing in mind that these bridges will also have to operate as sustainable performative devices that will improve the user experience.
    
    Serving as large planters for all types of vegetation to bloom and flourish, improving green parameters such as air quality without forgetting to generate the minimum footprint to preserve the natural ecosystem that runs below them.
    
    We decide to look at the bridge as a symbol of transition and universal understanding.
    
    The design will evoke a walk through the mountains, the thrill of crossing an abyss… suspended up in the air. The key element will be AIR.`,

    name: `CENTURY SQUARE`,
    location: 'Shanghai, China',
    date: 2020,
    typology: 'Urban Spaces',
    description: `The new design for the very significant “Century Square” at East Nanjing Road in Shanghai, opens like a shell and shows the splendour of its 'pearl', a shining kaleidoscope which reflects the new green urban scenery.

    “Century Square” has always been related to shows and events, positioned in a strategic connection between “Peoples Square” and “The Bund”, and characterized by its special ambience of incredible night lights and commercial presentations.
    
    Our project gives a homage to the origin of the word Shanghai, which means 'upon the sea'. We convert this very keyspace into a new urban living room, inspired in colours and shape by the sea and the harbour. The new paving represents an undersea world. This pavement becomes illuminated at night by glittering lights.
    
    We decide to renature this city centre, introducing green spaces to improve the urban microclimate in consideration of the ecological consciousness. Lights and audiovisuals enhance this new green open space at night.
    
    We merge the newly introduced ecological aspects with the heritage of the existing buildings and functional requirements. Shows of different natures will happen here, and the facades on Nanjing Road participate by hosting lights and screens, beautifully redesign.
    
    Our new kaleidoscope building is the new heart of the century square, its 'pearl'. It hosts spectacular shows, and it is a show in itself.
    
    The facades reflect like a water surface, by fragmenting and recomposing the lights and images of the surroundings, with its colourful paving and greenery, and with its commercials and historical buildings, Billboards, etc…
    
    The south side of the “Century Square” is organized by a topographic element: green hills, interwoven with the existing trees, support a wooden grandstand which can be used in many different ways; giving space to different functions such as cafeterias and shops, creating a new urban eco-living room.
    
    Green terraces and steps will allow people to sit at different levels, surrounded by trees and leaves, overviewing the vitality of the square. Different events take place here: product presentations, exhibitions, markets, culture and theatre events, adapting each time the scenario.
    
    Inside the kaleidoscope, small rooms invite the public to discover the square, the sky, the spirit of the city in between plants and mirrors.
    
    The renewed “Century Square” will become the highlight of East Nanjing Road, a new venue to experience the natural beauty of Shanghai.`,

    name: `A SCHOOL FOR COLOMBO`,
    location: 'Colombo, Sri Lanka',
    date: 2020,
    typology: 'Educational Spaces',
    description: `The school presented here has been designed for a competition in Sri-Lanka that called for an educational facility that centered community engagement. Before we started designing, we set up a group of principals that guided us throughout the design process.

    We wanted to mainly create a resilient structure that can potentially protect the inhabitants from the common fooding that occurs in the area. We also wanted to create a sense of ownership for the community it celebrates, where we not only give back the space to the community, but we also give them the freedom of deciding what happens next.

    Our school focuses on minimalizing dependence on public resources by harvesting solar energy, utilizing rainwater, and growing the bamboo that would be used as construction material on site. Our school is a landmark, both in form and in function, where the tower provides a visual marker for the surrounding community to signal the shelter. As well as act as the “well” or a place where people come to meet and gather.

    The school is meant to be an incomplete building that offers the infra-structure and the raw materials to the community so they can decide what happens next as their needs change over time. The sunken courtyard offers a lush green oasis in contrast to the tower and the foodwater both in form and quality.`,

    name: `SPECULATIONS ON WATER`,
    location: 'Quito, Ecuador',
    date: 2019,
    typology: 'Civc Spaces',
    description: `For this project, we studied closely the water problem in Quito Ecuador and its social, environmental, and economic effects on life near the Amazon. The premise of the studio was to propose a concept that would be a public institution, as well as an infrastructure complex that aimed to solve some of the water problems in Quito.

    Our proposal focused on “Parc El Sena” in central Quito and proposed a new way of raising awareness of the problem at hand for the locals in the city. The Machangara river that crosses the park is in a very bad condition right now, so we proposed a new “fake river” that follows the natural path of the river and would have allowed inhabitants to interact with a cleaner water as they refect on the conditions of the actual river down below. As the “fake river” weaves between the hills of the site it creates destinations along the way and in this case, it would have connected a natural history museum and a public swimming pool.

    A third portion of the project was dedicated to get visitors a third point of view to compare the conditions of the water on both levels below. At this observatory point sits a horse stable that acts as the overseer's tower.`,

    name: `EXPERIMENTAL HOUSING`,
    location: 'Munich, Germany',
    date: 2018,
    typology: 'Educational/ Residential Spaces',
    description: `The premise of the project was to come up with an experimental housing complex for the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Our proposal for this project was to present an Urban grid system that is modular and could be applied to any given site like a carpet/ tapestry, then respond to the topography and the boundaries of the specifc site accordingly. A series of different anomalies cut through the site to address issues of density and livability in the project offering spaces like green spaces and trails, communal assembly plaza, co-working/ co-studying spaces, shelters etc.
    
    The housing project was designed to house 4000 students and 1000 residents of different backgrounds. The design of this complex brings together people from mixed-age groups, mixed-income groups, and creates mixed land use spaces. The goal behind these ideas was to bring a sense of community and connectedness to the site which in turn would help with the social well- being of the residents.
    
    This complex does not only focus on the social sustainability, but it also takes into consideration the environmental sustainability starting from the materials used in the buildings construction to the water purifcation systems that incorporate facilities like the living machine and depends on collecting rainwater from the entire site to other facilities for recycling, composting, and vertical farming etc.`,

    name: `ROTATIVE`,
    location: 'Milan, Italy',
    date: 2020,
    typology: 'Urban Spaces',
    description: `This project is a response to “Il Corriere Della Sera”, an Italian Newspaper's call for a necessary revision of the Newsstand of the Future that responds to a new urban condition and a changing community.

    In our approach we studied the history of the “Edicola”, or the Newsstand. Tracing it back to its Turkish origin, or “Chiosco”, which was a place where Street vendors settled in public plazas to offer their goods and news to the passerbyers.

    We also studied the history and the process of making newspaper and were inspired by the image of the “rotative”; which is one of the main parts of the rotary printing press.

    In response to the crisis of the fading use of the printed newspaper, our approach reimagines the social interactions in the digital era we live in. We are adapting to the new ways of communication and new habits that have always been a bastion of culture and dialogue. The large rotary cylinders become a canopy, seat, and shelter to welcome the contemporary urban community.

    Our Newsstand of the Future proposes the most recognizable part of the making of the newspaper, the “rotative” as the image of the new urban element. People can participate in the creation of the newspaper and will transform the “rotative” in an urban element, a landmark of culture, and social encounter. We break the mono functional character of the original Edicola and multiply its elements and functions, allowing the Newsstand to obtain a more urban attribute: the plaza inside the plaza.`,
